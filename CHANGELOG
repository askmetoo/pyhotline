01-27-2013  v0.3.0  Daniel Selans
---------------------------------
Email reports now include the associated .gsm files as attachments.
Cepstral's Swift is now the only supported TTS engine.
All interactive prompts are now interruptible.

08-27-2012  v0.2.0  Daniel Selans
---------------------------------
Added 'Flite' TTS engine support (http://asterisk-flite.sourceforge.net/).
Note: When testing 'Flite', I ran into a strange issue where the TTS engine
would stop processing any further text if it ran into a comma. 

Added 'max_attempts'; this functionality allows you to set the number of call
attempts that will be made for an unresolved issue. Setting this value to 0
will cause pyhotline to call scheduled/emergency contacts until the issue
has been accepted.

Random bugfixes and code clean up:
    - updateStatus() wasn't updating the 'employee' column
    - Cleaned up some of the log messages
    - Added some additional info to the email notification template

Other random notes/ideas:
    - Option to email audio messages as attachments if 'email_notify' is set

07-17-2012  v0.1.9  Daniel Selans
---------------------------------
First release!

Some random ideas for future releases:
    - Definable pin_length in the config (currently hard coded to 5 digits)
    - Festival support, possibly another TTS engine?
    - SQL backend support 
    - Scriptable text-to-speech prompts
    - Custom email templates
    - SMS based notifications
    - Unavoidable bug fixes
